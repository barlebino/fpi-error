We can keep track of the where the solution may exist by using the fact that every iteration of fpi has an x-coordinate that is closer to the solution than that of the previous iteration. The solution cannot be at the midpoint of two subsequent iterations nor closer to the earlier iteration. The lower and upper bounds update based on the midpoint.
